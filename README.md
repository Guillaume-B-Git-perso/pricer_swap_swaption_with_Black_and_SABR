# pricer_swap_swaption_with_Black_and_SABR
Pricing of a swaps' surface and a swaptions' cube using the Black model and SABR volatilities

This project contains a Python notebook for multicurve pricing of interest rate instruments: vanilla swaps and swaptions.

The notebook is interactive and can be executed directly on Google Colab.
